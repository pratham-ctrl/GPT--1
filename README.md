# Local Command-Line Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a local command-line chatbot built with Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library.  
It runs fully offline, uses a small text generation model (`distilgpt2` by default), and maintains a short conversation memory using a sliding window buffer.  

The chatbot was developed as part of the **ATG Technical Assignment**.
